## Hi there 👋
I'm Parduh previously known as Kawaaii (Programming).  
- 👨‍💻 I'm some sort of a full-stack developer? If [this](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) description makes me a full-stack developer.
- 🌱 I work a lot with Javascript especially with NodeJS and I'm afraid for languages such as C++
- 🎮 I like gaming but I never know which games I wanna play and never play a game for long!
- 👯‍♀️ While I don't work much with others, I like to discuss coding with others and learn more.
- 📫 I do not write blog posts and my twitter is mostly used when I'm bored or waiting for something.
- ❓ Want to know more about me? You can always contact me via serval social medias!
